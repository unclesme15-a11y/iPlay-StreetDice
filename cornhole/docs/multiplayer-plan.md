# Multiplayer Plan

## Seats

Every match has 4 seats in 2v2 (2 in 1v1). **Any seat can be a Human or a Video Bot.**

```text
          FAR END
   [ B2 ]  [board]  [ A2 ]      <- your partner (A2) and their partner (B2)

             lane (27 ft)

   [ B1 ]  [board]  [ A1 ]      <- YOU (A1) and your direct opponent (B1)
          NEAR END (your camera)
```

- Each human always sees the game from **their own** pitcher's box. Every phone shows its owner as "the near end".
- The server stores the real positions, and each phone just rotates the table so its owner is at the bottom.

## How Humans And Bots Look The Same

The trick that makes mixing easy: **every seat, human or bot, is shown as a video character.**

- Video Bot: the server picks the throw and the bot's character clips play.
- Human: the person swipes on their phone, the server works out the throw, and **the video character the human picked as their avatar** plays the same throw clip on everyone else's screen.
- The only difference between a human and a bot is who decides the throw. The visuals don't change.

That means you can put **any mix** in a match: you + bot partner vs 2 humans, 2 humans + 2 bots, all bots for practice, and so on.

If a human doesn't pick an avatar, show a mic/profile marker with a throwing-arm silhouette instead, like the human seats in Street Dice.

## Throw Input (Server-Authoritative)

1. The phone sends only the **swipe**: power, aim angle, arc, and an optional spin.
2. The server adds a small random wobble and runs the bag physics with a seed.
3. The server returns the flight path as frames (the same pattern as `PhysicalRollTransport` in Street Dice) plus the final resting spot.
4. Every phone replays those same frames, so everybody sees the same landing.

The phone can't claim "I scored 3." It only sends the swipe.

## Video Bot Skill

| Level | In hole | On board | Off / foul |
|-------|---------|----------|------------|
| Rookie | 10% | 45% | 45% |
| Regular | 25% | 50% | 25% |
| Pro | 45% | 45% | 10% |

The server picks the bot's outcome from its level, then finds a throw that produces it. The flight always looks physically real because it comes from the same physics as a human throw.

Bots also use simple strategy: block the hole with a bag when they're ahead, and try to knock an opponent's woody off when they're behind.

## Voice

- Team voice channel plus table voice channel (Vivox, reusing the Street Dice token signer).
- Video bots get short "table talk" reaction clips instead of voice.

## Disconnects

- A human who drops gets 30 s to come back. Their seat is then taken over by a Video Bot at the same skill level until the game ends. Nothing is forfeited unless there's a wager on the game.
